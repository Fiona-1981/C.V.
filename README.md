## Work Experience

I've spent over twenty-two years in the media industry. Bringing people together through humour, finding out people's interests and creating strong team bonds that outlast employment. 
My work has been varied, including radio, television, advertising and post produciton. I've seen a lot. I can mentor inexperienced people and hold my ground with the bigwigs. My next employer won't need to ease me in to non-technical matters, let's just cut straight to the job please!
